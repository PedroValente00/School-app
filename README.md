# School-app

This is a small app made with Express, EJS and MongoDB.

It's being continuously integrated/deployed/updated from Github thanks to [Render](https://render.com/).

Because it's a free tier, the website "goes down" if there's no inbound traffic for 15 minutes. 
If you try to access it when it's down, the first request can take up to 1 minute to load which means the first visit during the down period will suffer a very noticeable delay until the website is back up.
